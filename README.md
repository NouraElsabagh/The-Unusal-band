# The-Unusal-band
The basis of each instrument in our band is a capacitive sensor. We used two Arduino boards with the open-source Capacitive Sensor library to convert the pins on our Arduinos into sensors. These sensors can pick up changes in electrical capacitance of any conductive objects that they are wired to. The use of these “sensors”, which are just wires transmitting a current, eliminates the need for an external sensor. The picked-up voltage is then converted into an analog value, that stimulates the buzzer to produce a specific pitch.
